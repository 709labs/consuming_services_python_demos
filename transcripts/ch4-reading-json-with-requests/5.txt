00:00 Let's review the core concepts about accessing Json services with Requests, 
00:03 of course we are going to start by importing Request, 
00:06 I have to have the url to the service that we are going to call, 
00:10 in this case we are just going to do a basic get so we say request.get given the url, 
00:13 we get our response back and we've worked with this already,
00:16 but the thing that is new this time is we now can call .json 
00:20 and that will directly translate the text, 
00:23 string representation of Json into a Python dictionary 
00:27 and then we just work with the data in there 
00:29 in our example we got the clone url for the get clone command 
00:33 from wherever repository we were pointing at in the API.
