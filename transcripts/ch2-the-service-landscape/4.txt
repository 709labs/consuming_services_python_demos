00:01 Finally, let's talk about queuing. 
00:03 We are not going to cover queuing in this class, 
00:06 but if we are taking the survey of the range of possible ways 
00:10 of communicating with services, queuing probably shouldn't be left out. 
00:13 So queuing is typically done sort of behind the firewall, right, 
00:16 so I've got a set of apps they are running behind the firewall, 
00:20 one of them is going to get some sort of operation, 
00:23 it's going to add some kind of work or message to the queue 
00:27 later on asynchronously another app that might pick that up and do something, 
00:32 so for example, hey I am a web server, will you send an email to this person, 
00:35 and I am going to carry on serving at my web pages. 
00:38 Some other sort of email work or process might grab that go yeah sure, 
00:42 I will start the outbound email campaign to this person. 
00:45 That is queuing, we are not going to cover queuing in this class, 
00:48 but just to round down the spectrum there you have it.
